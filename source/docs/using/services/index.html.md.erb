title: Using Services
---

Cloud Foundry Services are any type of add-on that can be provisioned alongside your application; for example, a database or an account on a third-party SaaS provider.

A service may support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service instance is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in a `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable in JSON format that are visible to the application process.
